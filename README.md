Structured German language grammar algorithm for programmers written in PHP

Currently this is just my private notebook, but you are welcome to contribute, so togather we can make first structured grammer book that engineering minds can easily understand.

PS. Some code will be in Latvian, since this is my native language, but mostly I will try to write in English.
